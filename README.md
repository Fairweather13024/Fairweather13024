### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Mark. Think of me as a product/business-oriented full-stack engineer with an academic background in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
I have no public repos because I often work on commercial products.
If you would like to get to know more about my work schedule a meeting at https://calendly.com/markericfairweather/30min
